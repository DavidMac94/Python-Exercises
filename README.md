# Python-Exercises
Various programming exercises (mostly from Python Programming: An Introduction to Computer Science)

Wimbledon:
Wimbledon.py accurately simulate a game of tennis on a wimbledon style scoreboard.
The user can choose player names and the probability that each player wins a point on their serve. Once the sim is started,
the program simulates a coinflip to decide who is serving. The user can then press play point to play the next point in
the match until the match is done. The user can also end the sim at any point. The scoreboard has all the same details as the real scoreboard; player names, dot to indicate server,
current set score and previous set scores.
